# CC-Project
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This project does not require any WEB Container to expose REST services
# Due to this configuration just one class (Resource) has been marked with REST tags.



# Run "query.sql" file to create DB, Tables (User table includes an insert for a default user)
# Main class will start a server on the URL: http://localhost:8084/resources
# To get the default user with the API use this URL: http://localhost:8084/resources/user/admin
